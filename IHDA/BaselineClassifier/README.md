1. The script_baseline_classifier_fc.ipynb is used to train the fully connected baseline classifier according to: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328679101_Benchmarking_the_SHL_Recognition_Challenge_with_Classical_and_Deep-Learning_Pipelines
2. In the file directory of the file 'IHDA' needs to be specified.
3. The data used to train the baseline classifier will be stored in the file /IHDA/BaselineClassifier/Classifier/Data
4. The final model and the one that achieves the lowest training validation accuracy will be saved in: /IHDA/BaselineClassifier/Classifier as final_model.pth and best_model.pth
